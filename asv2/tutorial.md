## Registering an Attestation as an Issuer
The following parameters are required 
1. Identifier
2. account 
3. timestamp for when the attestation was issued

The following is the code snippet, using web3js, to register an attestation  

note: the respective ABI's can be generated from the corresponding contact under ./contracts
```typescript
    const identifier = "+18006540202"
    const identifierInBytes32Format = web3.utils.soliditySha3({
        t: "bytes32",
        v: identifier,
    });
    
    const testAccount = web3.eth.accounts.create().address;
    const issuedOnTimestamp = Math.floor(new Date().getTime() / 1000);

    const federatedAttestationsInstance = new web3.eth.Contract(
      FA_CONTRACT.abi,
      FA_PROXY_ADDRESS
    );

    await federatedAttestationsInstance.methods
        .registerAttestationAsIssuer(
            identifierInBytes32Format,
            testAccount,
            issuedOnTimestamp
        ).send()
```

## Looking up an Attestation
When looking up an attestation, make sure to use the same identifier when registering. 
The issuer address should correspond to the account that submitted the transaction. 
```typescript
    const attestations = await federatedAttestationsInstance.methods
      .lookupAttestations(identifier, [issuerAddress])
      .call();
```
